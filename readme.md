# Payroll Re-factoring

The program calculates total payroll given developer pay rate and hours worked.

The original program is in the "Start" branch of this repo, the re-factored
program is in the "Refactored" branch.

## Project Structure

The App project contains the SalaryCalculator and the App.Test project contains
a test. Re-factor and create tests. The original test should continue to pass
during re-factoring.

Have Fun!
